>    * Make sure it appears in 'Vendor Dashboard → All Properties' and in the public catalog.
>    * Booking flow should store data in the `bookings` folder/collection created earlier.
>
> *Output:*
>
> * Update the frontend to display this listing beautifully.
> * Ensure room categories are shown clearly, with images, facilities, and prices.
> * Verify that a booking record is created after confirmation.
