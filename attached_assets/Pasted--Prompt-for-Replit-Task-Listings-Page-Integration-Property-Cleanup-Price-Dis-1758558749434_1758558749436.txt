### Prompt for Replit

**Task:** Listings Page Integration + Property Cleanup + Price Display (with fallback)

---

#### 1️⃣ Replace Property Page With Listings Page

* Across the entire site, replace all routes and links pointing to the old “Property Page” with the **new Listings Catalog page** (the ByHours-style catalog).
* Update:

  * Header nav items
  * Footer links
  * Any “View All Properties” buttons
  * Vendor/admin redirects after adding a new property

---

#### 2️⃣ Remove Unneeded Dummy Properties

* From the database, **delete every dummy property** except:

  * `Pearl Continental Karachi`
  * `Sunrise Residency Gulshan`
* Verify these two properties display correctly on:

  * Vendor dashboard
  * Listings page
  * Single-listing page

---

#### 3️⃣ Price Display in Listings Catalog

* On every property card in the catalog:

  * Show the price for these four options (using the current property pricing fields):

    * `4 Hours`
    * `6 Hours`
    * `12 Hours`
    * `24 Hours`
  * If the property has multiple room categories:

    * For each duration, display the **lowest price** across all categories.
    * Example:

      * Deluxe Room → 4h = 5,000 | 6h = 7,000
      * Standard Room → 4h = 3,500 | 6h = 5,500
      * Display → “From PKR 3,500 (4h)” etc.

✅ **Fallback rule for missing prices:**

* If the vendor didn’t set a price for a given duration (4h, 6h, 12h, or 24h), display `Not Available` in that duration’s box.

---

#### 4️⃣ Testing & Validation

* Check both `Pearl Continental Karachi` and `Sunrise Residency Gulshan`:

  * They should appear in the catalog with the correct prices or `Not Available` for unset durations.
  * “Book Now” must still link to the single-property page.
* Verify that no pages or buttons still point to the old property page.

---

#### 5️⃣ Deliverables

* Site-wide integration of the new listings catalog.
* Database cleaned with only the two specified properties.
* Pricing table in the catalog shows:

  * Cheapest category price for each duration.
  * `Not Available` where vendor hasn’t set a price.
